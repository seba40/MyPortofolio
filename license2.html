    <h1>User Fee</h1>
    <p class="number">The Client is obligated to pay the Provider a User Fee in accordance with the current price
                      list. The prices in the price list are exclusive of value added tax as well as other taxes and
                      charges.</p>
    <p class="number">The User Fee will be invoiced by the Provider (monthly/quarterly) and shall be paid by the

                      further notification.</p>
    <h1>System Description / Functionalities</h1>
    <p class="number">The Avelon Software shall be provided to the Client for use via a data network (Internet
                      standing line, Internet, Internet dial-up connection, virtual private network (VPN) or GSM
                      cellular phone service, etc.).</p>
    <p class="number">The use of the Avelon Software by the Client is carried out by remote access by means of the
                      Client&prime;s mobile or stationary end devices. The Avelon Software will not be installed in browser
                      environments on the Client&prime;s end devices.</p>
    <p class="number">The Avelon Software comprises communication end points for plant installation gateways, graphic
                      visualization interfaces, data interfaces for the exchange of user data as well as
                      communication channels for mobile end devices, such as Short Message Service.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client is free, at his discretion and subject to the provisions of this contract, to
                      install software created by the Provider on mobile end devices (apps) for the exclusive use of
                      the Avelon system.</p>
    <p class="number">The system requirements for use and the network connection described in Section IV can be
                      adapted by the Provider unilaterally at any time subject to a notification period of one
                      month.</p>
    <h1>System Requirements, Use, Network Connection</h1>
    <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    <p class="number">Flash Player must be installed in browser environments.</p>
    <p class="number">In the case of software installations (apps) on mobile end devices, the requirements of the
                      respective end-device manufacturer must be observed.</p>
    <p class="number">The Provider urgently recommends that the Client maintain all necessary software environments
                      on the end devices in an up-to-date state due to security concerns.</p>
    <h2>Network Connection</h2>
    <p class="number">The Avelon system uses ports 80 and 443 (SSL) for the transfer of data.</p>
    <h1>Warranty of Quality</h1>
    <p class="number">Contractual use means the use of the Avelon Software subject to compliance with the system
                      requirements and conditions of use agreed upon in Section IV as well as with due diligence.</p>
    <p>Availability</p>
    <p class="number">The Provider guarantees a server availability of the Avelon Software in the amount of 97% per
                      year (measured at the server).</p>
    <p class="number">The Provider is entitled to interrupt the use of the Avelon Software for eight hours for
                      maintenance tasks after a notification period of one week. Interruptions for which notification
                      has been made shall not be included in the calculation of the availability.</p>
    <p class="number"> Irrespective of the contractually agreed upon interruptions, the Provider shall make every
                       reasonable effort to repair interruptions of use as quickly as possible.</p>
    <h2>Extent of the Warranty</h2>
    <p class="number">A defect under the terms of the warranty shall exist if, when used in accordance with the
                      contract, the Avelon Software does not fulfill the functionalities as described in Section III or
                      the availability as per Items 15 - 17 of this contract.</p>
    <h2>Obligation to Notify of Defects</h2>
    <p class="number">The Client must notify the Provider in writing of a defect within 3 calender days after it has
                      been discovered and must include sufficient documentation.</p>
    <h2>Remedying of Defects</h2>
    <p class="number">Defects in the Avelon Software shall be remedied by rectification or replacement delivery at
                      the Provider&prime;s discretion. A workaround or suppression of a defect shall also be deemed a
                      permissible rectification.</p>
    <p class="number">If the rectification or replacement delivery fails repeatedly, the Client is entitled to
                      withdraw from this contract. The exercise of the right of withdrawal by the Client terminates
                      the Client&prime;s right of use for the Avelon Software.</p>
    <p>Limitation of the Warranty of Quality</p>
    <p class="number">All further warranty claims on the part of the Client (including the right to reduce the User
                      Fee or to damage compensation) are expressly excluded.</p>
    <p class="number">The Provider is released from his warranty obligation to the extent that a defect of the
                      software is due to circumstances for which he is not responsible.</p>
    <h1>Warranty of Title</h1>
    <p class="number">The Provider is the owner and holder of the rights to the Avelon Software and to the licensing
                      of the same.</p>
    <h2>Indemnity and Defense</h2>
    <p class="number">The Provider indemnifies the Client from every liability for the infringement of (Swiss)
                      copyrights (and other intangible property rights) of third parties, provided that and inasmuch
                      as the infringement of said rights of third parties is caused exclusively by the contractual
                      use of the Avelon Software.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client shall notify the Provider immediately and in writing of claims made by third
                      parties and shall authorize the same to carry out the defense, including the effecting of a
                      settlement. The Client shall support the Provider to a just and reasonable extent.</p>
    <h2>Measures</h2>
    <p class="number">In the interest of defense against third-party claims, the Provider is entitled, at his
                      discretion, to obtain the right for the Client to continue use of the Avelon Software or to
                      replace or modify the same without degrading the functionalities described in Section III.
                      Should none of these measures be possible for the Provider, the Provider is entitled to withdraw
                      from this contract. The exercise of this right by the Provider terminates the right of the
                      Client to use the Avelon Software.</p>
    <p class="number"> Any and every further warranty on the part of the Provider over and against the Client is
                       excluded in the event of actual or asserted claims of third parties.</p>
    <h1>Liability</h1>
    <p class="number"> For direct or immediate damage caused culpably, each Party shall be liable over and against
                       the other Party only up to a maximum amount of CHF 50,000. Liability for indirect or
                       consequential damage is hereby excluded. Limitation of liability and exclusion of liability shall
                       apply both for contractual and for non-contractual or quasi-contractual claims.</p>
    <h1>The Client&prime;s Duty to Cooperate</h1>
    <p class="number">The Client is obligated to use the respective most-current Avelon Software version inasmuch as
                      this can reasonably be expected of the Client. The Provider shall notify the Client and the
                      authorized users at least two weeks in advance when the Avelon Software is to be updated.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client commits to install the Client software delivered by the Provider and any updates
                      without delay on the computers that have access authorization and on mobile end devices. The
                      Client is entitled to reproduce the Client software provided that reproduction is necessary for
                      the contractual use of the software. Among the necessary forms of reproduction are installation
                      and the loading of the Client software in the working memory.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the telecommunication
                      connection required for the contractual use of the Avelon Software between the Client&prime;s computers
                      and/or mobile end devices and the telecommunication interconnection point.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client commits to compliance with the system requirements defined in Section IV. The
                      Client shall ensure that the persons authorized to use the Avelon Software understand the proper
                      operation of the Client software.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client is responsible for the management of the user names and passwords provided by the
                      Provider. User names and passwords must be kept confidential by the Client, must not be passed on
                      and must be protected against unauthorized access by third parties.</p>
    <h1>Confidentiality</h1>
    <p class="number">Each Party shall handle the information provided by the other Party with strict
                      confidentiality, shall protect it from unauthorized access by third parties and shall not use or
                      exploit it either directly or indirectly to their own advantage and shall keep it strictly secret,
                      meaning that it shall not be made available to unauthorized parties and shall remain protected
                      from unauthorized access. For the purposes of this provision, unauthorized also means employees
                      and vicarious agents or subcontractors engaged by the Parties for purposes other than those in
                      accordance with this contract.</p>
    <h1>Data Storage / Data Backup</h1>
    <p class="number">Storage space shall be provided to the Client on the Provider&prime;s server for the purpose of
                      storing the data in connection with the use of the Avelon Software. The transfer of the
                      application data to the data server shall be performed after consultation between the Parties.</p>
    <p class="number">The Client is entitled to access the stored application data at any time subject to the
                      provisions of Items 15 and 16 in this contract. The transfer and processing of the application
                      data is the exclusive responsibility of the Client.</p>
    <p class="number">The Provider is responsible for the backup of the Client&prime;s application data stored on the data
                      server. The data backup is performed once daily. The daily data backups shall be retained by the
                      Provider for one week; the weekly data backups shall be retained for one month. After expiration
                      of this safekeeping period, the Provider is entitled to overwrite the saved backup application
                      data.</p>
    <p class="number">The capacity of the saved Client data is limited. When the limit is exceeded, the oldest
                      Client data shall be overwritten automatically and without previous notification.</p>
    <h1>Data Security</h1>
    <p class="number">If the Client processes application data of a personal nature in the context of this
                      contractual relationship, the Client shall be responsible for compliance with the regulations
                      concerning data privacy laws. The application data that is transferred from the Client shall only
                      be processed by the Provider in accordance with the Client&prime;s directives. In the event that the
                      Provider is of the opinion that a directive of the Client violates regulations concerning data
                      privacy laws, the Provider shall notify the Client of this without delay.</p>
